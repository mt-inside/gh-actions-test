# Note the commits operated on are based from GITHUB_REF, but I think we could just use `git describe` becuase I'm sure the repo is checked out to that point. eg
#   git for-each-ref --count=1 --sort='-*authordate' --format='%(*refname:short)' 'refs/tags'
#   git describe --abbrev=0 --tags $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)^
